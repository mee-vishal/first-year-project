                    <p>Team Daksh was originated by a clique of students who had the notion to form a team that would
                        give the team members a pragmatic approach toward the automotive field. Apart from studying the
                        curriculum taught in the college, the team has put in a lot of endeavors to fabricate the
                        vehicle distinguishing our vehicle from other vehicles at national as well as international
                        level. The team has been successful in promoting greener mobility as well as the need to shift
                        to renewable sources of energy. The team has brought many laurels to the institute and is
                        determined to continue itâ€™s legacy.The number of renewable energy-based vehicles is going to
                        rise exponentially in the coming years. We hope to be part of this change, and that"s why our
                        goal is to participate in ESVC(Electric solar vehicle championship) 2023, organized by ISIE
                        India. Through this competition, we hope to increase our technical competence in this
                        non-conventional field.</p>
